# in order to reference the secrets in pods add env
env:
  - name: SECRET_USERNAME
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mysecret
        key: username
# Or you can also mount using secrets in volumes
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mypod
      image: redis
      volumeMounts:
        - name: foo
          mountPath: "/etc/foo"
  volumes:
    - name: foo
      secret:
        secretName: mysecret
        defaultMode: 0400
# There is another approach which is during imagePull
# but not much useful according to me
